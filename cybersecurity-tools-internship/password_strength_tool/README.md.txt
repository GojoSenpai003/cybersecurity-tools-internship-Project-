This is a GUI-based Python tool that allows users to test the strength of their passwords and generate personalized wordlists for password auditing or ethical hacking simulations.

**Key Features:**
- Developed using the Tkinter GUI framework
- Uses the `zxcvbn` library to analyze password strength
- Provides real-time feedback including crack time estimates, strength score (0â€“4), warnings, and improvement suggestions
- Accepts user-specific inputs such as name, date of birth, and pet name to generate custom wordlists
- Includes leetspeak transformations and common suffixes (e.g., 123, @123, !, 2025)
- Exports the generated wordlist as a `.txt` file

This tool demonstrates an understanding of social engineering, brute-force techniques, and password entropy evaluation.
